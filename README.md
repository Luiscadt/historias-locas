Luis the YouTuber and His Malib Code

Luis, the YouTuber, has created this code to prompt the user for inputs to create a "malib" (mad-libs style) sentence about computer programming. The program starts by printing the name of the YouTuber using two different methods. Then, it prompts the user to enter an adjective, two verbs, and the name of a famous person.

Once the user enters the inputs, the program generates a sentence using the `malib` variable that incorporates the inputs. The sentence expresses Luis's excitement about computer programming and encourages the user to stay hydrated like the famous person they entered.

Overall, this code shows Luis's enthusiasm for coding and his creativity in using Python to generate fun and engaging content for his audience on YouTube.
